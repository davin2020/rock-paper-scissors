# Rock, Paper, Scissors Challenge

From the [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) website

## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this Rock, Paper, Scissors game and get it looking as close to the design as possible - using HTML, CSS and JavaScript

Your users should be able to:
- Play Rock, Paper, Scissors against the computer

### Rules for Original Version

If the player wins, they gain 1 point. If the computer wins, the player loses one point.

- Paper beats Rock
- Rock beats Scissors
- Scissors beats Paper

## Status
I've got the main functionality of the game working, and most of the styling/layout

You can pick an icon by clicking on it, the house then randomly picks an icon, and the result and score are displayed

## Problem Solving approach for this Challenge
The first time I tried this challenge, earlier in the year, I approached it from a layout/styling-first perspective, and TBH didnt get very far with that approach as I'm more of a backend person. Last month in October I tried the challenge again, and this time decided on a functionality-first approach, which has worked out better for me. 

Below is a rough summary of how I broke the challenge down into really smalll tasks, within different branches, and worked in an iterative way to create and then improve the games's functionality and then layout/styling.

### branch v3_functionality: auto picking 2 icons at random and showing output via the console
- make an array with 3 items
- pick an item at random from the array
- display the result ie the picked icon
- repeat this twice, once for each player
- compare the Player1 and Player2 icons
- work out the winner and give them 1 point
<!-- display the score -->

### branch v4_interactive: let the user pick an icon

### branch v5_score

### branch v6_new_readme

### branch v7_styling
