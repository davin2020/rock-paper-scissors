# Rock, Paper, Scissors Challenge

From the [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) website

## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this Rock, Paper, Scissors game and get it looking as close to the design as possible - using HTML, CSS and JavaScript

Your users should be able to:
- Play Rock, Paper, Scissors against the computer

### Rules for Original Version

If the player wins, they gain 1 point. If the computer wins, the player loses one point.

- Paper beats Rock
- Rock beats Scissors
- Scissors beats Paper

## Status
I've got the main functionality of the game working, but no styling/layout yet.

You can pick an icon by clicking on it, the house then randomly picks an icon, and the result and score are dispalyed
